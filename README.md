# Libft
Open source C library functions specific for 42 Silicon Valley.

## Introduction to Libft:
This first project marks the beginning of your training at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) to become de software engineer.

The goal of the `libft` project is to build on the concepts you learned during `Day-06` of the [Piscine Bootcamp](https://www.42.us.org/program/piscine/) by coding a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C projects this year. 

The C Standard Library is a set of C built-in functions, constants and header files like `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<math.h>`, etc. This project has certain restrictions that prohibit the use of these standard C libraries. 
Because we don't have access to those highly useful standard functions, we have to re-write those functions, to understand them and to learn how to use them currently. 

### Objectives:
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.

Through this project, we have the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own that will be used throughout the year. 

### Goal:
The `Libft` project incorporates very useful functions, including binary trees, linked lists, stacks, arrays, bit manipulation, and more. By developing this library, I'm seeking to gain a thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.

## Getting Started
### Compiling
Run the following commands:

- To compile
`make`

- To remove objects:
`make clean`

- To remove objects and binary file (program):
`make fclean`

- To re-compile:
`make re`

- Executing
To test the library, compile with your program. i.e.

`./program libft.a`

### Known Issues
Currently fixing compilation errors due to some missing functions.

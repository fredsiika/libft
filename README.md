# Libft
Open source C library functions specific for 42 Silicon Valley.

## About Libft
This first project marks the beginning of your training at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) to become de software engineer.

The goal of the `libft` project is to build on the concepts you learned during `Day-06` of the [Piscine Bootcamp](https://www.42.us.org/program/piscine/) by coding a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C projects this year. 

The C Standard Library is a set of C built-in functions, constants and header files like `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<math.h>`, etc. This project has certain restrictions that prohibit the use of these standard C libraries. 
Because we don't have access to those highly useful standard functions, we have to re-write those functions, to understand them and to learn how to use them currently. 

It incorporates very useful functions, including binary trees, linked lists, stacks, arrays, bit manipulation, and more. By developing this library, I gained a thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.

## Getting Started
### Compiling
Run the following commands:

- To compile
`make`

- To remove objects:
`make clean`

- To remove objects and binary file (program):
`make fclean`

- To re-compile:
`make re`

- Executing
To test the library, compile with your program. i.e.

`./program libft.a`

### Known Issues
Currently fixing compilation errors due to some missing functions.

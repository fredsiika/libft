# Libft
Open source C library functions specific for 42 Silicon Valley.

## About Libft
This projects seeks to build on the concepts learned during the c piscine (bootcamp), to code a library of useful functions that will be allowed to be reused in future projects. Because we don't have access to those highly useful standard functions, we have to re-write those functions, to understand them and to learn how to use them currently. 

It incorporates very useful functions, including binary trees, linked lists, stacks, arrays, bit manipulation, and more. By developing this library, I gained a thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.

## Getting Started
### Compiling
Run the following commands:

- To compile
`make`

- To remove objects:
`make clean`

- To remove objects and binary file (program):
`make fclean`

- To re-compile:
`make re`

- Executing
To test the library, compile with your program. i.e.

`./program libft.a`
